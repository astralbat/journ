# Example: adjust_python_lib.sh target/release/journ

# This script provides an example of distributing journ to other Mac machines,
# as when journ is built, it is linked against the builders machine's python framework
# location. This can be made more generic by using 'Current' instead of the version number
# in the framework path.
# On Mac, journ will likely be installed with brew and a post install script should emulate this
# logic to ensure a suitable version of python exists and update the exe.
